# EDA-on-Students-Performance
This is my first project on Github

## Overview
The project focuses on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the given Students Performance dataset, which includes marks obtained by students in different subjects. The aim was to first clean (if necessary) the data and then perform a full Exploratory Data Analysis (with summary statistics, plots and questions that will be raised), which would help to understand the variation within the variables.

## Some of the key methods which were used throughout the work are:
1. Data cleaning
2. Visualization - EDA
3. Summary statistics
4. Checking outliers
